	</div>

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos1">I was introduced to 5 Borough Bike Club, “New York’s Friendliest Bike Club”, through my Collab: Branding class in 2019 at Parsons. 5BBC prides itself on being a community of bikers dedicated to safe cycling for people of all skill levels. However, their membership numbers were not where they wanted them to be. So they tasked us with helping them rebrand and advertise their club in order to increase membership.</p>

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos2">Although they have yet to use our work for their brand, it was an enlightening, valuable experience. I was chosen to be one of two project managers in this process, overseeing the work of about 20 people as well as helping to ideate and design throughout the rebranding process.</p>

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos3">We started this process by addressing their current logo. Through several discussions with the president of the club, Allan Friedman, we determined that the biggest issues with the logo are the ones highlighted here.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos4">With those main points in mind my classmates and I brainstormed and designed potential logos. These are a few example iterations that I created, with the final version meant to resemble a bike chain.

	</div>

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos5">We also worked on coming up with new ways for members to interact with the 5BBC brand. This is when I came up with the idea of an Adventure Diary for 5BBC members to use on or after their bike trips. I was inspired by scrapbooking and family photo albums as 5BBC's culture struck me as akin to a family. With this Adventure Diary members would have a special place to put their memories of their experiences with 5BBC. So, this is the first draft of the Adventure Diary using the logo I created.

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos6">However, after reviewing many logo ideas and going back and forth with Allan Friedman, the 5BBC board members settled on this final logo.

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos7">As you can see here, these are the reasons why we chose this logo as the final for 5BBC's rebrand.

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos8">With the logo determined, we set to work on the brand assets. One of the ideas the board members enjoyed was my Adventure Diary, so I set to work on redesigning it with the new logo and brand identity.

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos9">I then focused on some of the marketing and advertising for the club. This included creating a mockup of a tent setup 5BBC could use at the next New York Bike Expo.

	<div>
		<p class="fbbcExp" id="fbbcExpPos10">The final part of the rebranding that I helped out with, along with a couple of other classmates, were the social media mockups. They already had Facebook and Instagram accounts so it was just a matter of incorporating the new brand elements.
