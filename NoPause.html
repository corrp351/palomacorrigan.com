		<p class="NoPauseExp" id="NoPauseExpPos1">In today's world it's hard to find a place to make your mark. In one of my branding classes junior year at Parsons, I was asked to work on a project that would help people from Generation X (Gen X - ages 38 to 53). Right away I thought about some of the women in my life around this age. Quite often they all seem to mention menopause as a big stressor in their lives and I wanted to take this opportunity to explore that. This is how NoPause was born. Now, although this project has not gone any further than the brand book you see here, I hope that someday in the future I can continue my work on this subject as a passion project.

	<div>
		<p class="NoPauseExp" id="NoPauseExpPos2">There are far too many women going through this completely natural, healthy experience for there to be so few resources for them to use on a daily basis.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p class="NoPauseExp" id="NoPauseExpPos3">So, for the puprose of this project I knew I had to learn all about my target audience (the women of gen X) in order to create something meaningful. Of course, there is a lot more information regarding gen X women than what is shared here, but I narrowed it down to what I felt were the most relevant facts to my brand.

	<div>
		<p class="NoPauseExp" id="NoPauseExpPos4">After this extensive research, I started to ideate and create the different parts of NoPause like the color scheme, the technical do's and don'ts, and possible products and services.

		<p class="NoPauseExp" id="NoPauseExpPos5">In terms of the brand's color scheme I did some research and found that these colors I've chosen for the brand inspire strength, calm, and trust.

	<div>
		<p class="NoPauseExp" id="NoPauseExpPos6">With the colors established, I then went into the other parts of the brand.
