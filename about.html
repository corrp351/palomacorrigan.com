		Hello again! Thank you for your interest in me! Here are a few more points to help you get to know me; and hover over a fact for a little something extra.
	</div>

	<div class="aboutText" id="p2">

		<p>I was lucky enough to live in New York City for the 4 years I went to university.</p>

		<span id="p2popup">
			One of my favorite teachers from my freshman year at Parsons says that anyone who lives in the city for longer than a year is a New Yorker. That stuck with me, so even though I no longer live there, I still feel that I am, at least in part, a New Yorker. Being someone who spent some of the most formative years of my life in a city that is bigger than life itself, I learned so much more than what is taught in a classroom. I learned how to walk fast, how to get lost in Central Park, and how museums aren't always huge biuldings with lavish steps and security guards. But one of the most significant lessons I also learned living in the city is that nothing can happen without cooperation and respecting others, whether that be outside in the streets or inside a classroom.

		<p>Another fact about myself is that I absolutely love fantasy.</p>

		<span id="p3popup">
			It all started with Harry Potter, the first and BEST fantasy I've ever experienced. Since then, I've just grown to love how the genre of fantasy, in regards to anything (art, literature, even in religion), is based in reality, but then challenges us to see past that, to find spectacular and new realities. I feel like in these other worlds we create or visit, we not only practice our imaginative muscles, but we open our minds a little more each time so that in the "real" world we're able to truly innovate. despite the clich√©, I'll admit that my favorite work of fantasy is Harry Potter.

		<p>Finally, for now, my favorite designers and inspirations are MinaLima, Milton Glaser, and Marian Bantjes.</p>

			<li>"What is central to our way of designing is to marry the digital with the analog...Handwork is stiill very much part of how we work and on most occasions occasions is the critical beginning." - Eduardo Lima</li>
			<li>"We're always looking, but we never really see." - Milton Glaser</li> 
			<li>"...I find that for myself, without exception, the more I deal with the work as something that is my own, as something that is personal, the more successful it is." - Marian Bantjes</li>
